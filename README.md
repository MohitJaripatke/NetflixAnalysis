**Important note about rating system:**

The Motion Picture Association film rating system is used in the United States and its territories to rate a motion picture's suitability for certain audiences based on its content. The system and the ratings applied to individual motion pictures are the responsibility of the Motion Picture Association (MPA), previously known as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) from 1945 to 2019. The MPA rating system is a voluntary scheme that is not enforced by law.


G – General Audiences (All ages admitted. Nothing that would offend parents for viewing by children)

PG – Parental Guidance Suggested (Some material may not be suitable for children. Parents urged to give "parental guidance")

PG-13 – Parents Strongly Cautioned (Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13. Parents are urged to be cautious)

R – Restricted (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian)
